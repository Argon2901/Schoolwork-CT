1. Passengers arrive and are put into a queue if there isn't a valid 
configuration or if the boat is not there. If the boat is there and there is
a valid configuration then they wake hte other passengers' threads with a 
signal and tell them to get on the boat, and then they signal the boat to go.
If the boat arrives and there's already a valid 3 person configuration then 
the boat wakes their threads and then sets off. Passengers on the boat are held
in a condition variable wait stopping them from doing anything until the boat is
done and signals them to get off.  

2. Every boat load only ever could load 3 total people. There isn't code to take
any more. It can never take less than 3 people since it's only ever allowed 
through a condition variable if there is a valid configuration of 3 people. 

3. Every time the boat arrives and every time a new passenger stops for the boat
there is a check to see if a valid configuration is there. In that case, whoever 
just arrives wakes the other threads that would enter the boat and their ID is 
logged. The boat and moniter then tally up their id's and the boat sets off. 

4. 
a) Nobody can get off before the crossing completes because they are locked in
a condition variable that stops their threads from continuing until the boat 
stops and signals them. 
b) While the boat is crossing the river there is a flag that automatically pushes
new passengers into a waiting condition, which is only allowed to be freed when
the boat arrives back and un-sets the flag. 
c) Every person who starts the wait automatically registers themselves and are 
held in a waiting queue. Nobody that isn't in the condition variable queue can
get on the boat. 
d) Same explanation as a)
